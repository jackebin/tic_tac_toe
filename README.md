An unbelievable boring game

Oh such a boring classic!

Now, I'm a Linux Beginner, C beginner and a Github beginner but will in time slowly learn this platform. 
For now, contrary to how I guess this platform works and what's making it so great in the first place, I will 
post every new iteration of this game in folders (V1 as in version one etc). In this way, I or anyone else interested 
can watch how my skills (hopefully) improves. With that said, I don't know how much more time I'm going to spend on
this game. It's not going to be more fun and after I'd played around with structs in V2 I feel it's time to create
other projects while using github the proper way =)
